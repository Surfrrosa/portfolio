I dreamed of being an astronomer as a kid. Which led me to reading books like The Nature of Space and Time. Physics led me deep into philosophy, which never got boring. Philosophy opened something different, and that pulled me toward psychology. I got a degree in it, fell in love with neuroscience, which was my concentration. Neuroscience got me interested in biology and anatomy. Which turned into somatic work, how the body holds what the mind doesn't fully process. Somatic work led me into quantum physics, where observation affects outcome, and the measurement problem starts sounding a lot like ancient philosophy. And that landed me in full-blown spirituality.

You start looking up at the sky as a kid and end up looking inward and finding the same architecture. Every neuron could be its own galaxy. Every mind, a whole universe. The microcosm and the macrocosm keep mirroring each other the closer you look.

That sounds scattered if you're reading it from the outside. From the inside, it was one continuous thread. Each subject handed me off to the next, not because I lost interest, but because the edges of one thing kept pointing toward the center of something else. I work in spirals. I've always worked in spirals. And at a certain point, the patterns start to reveal themselves. You realize none of it was ever separate. It's all the same fabric. You were always circling the same questions, just from different rooms.

## dream weaver

Barbara Sher called people like this Scanners. I've also heard jack of all trades, renaissance thinker, generalist. None of them really land. They describe the outside of it but miss the inside entirely.

From the inside, it feels like building a catalog.

Not a pile of unfinished interests. Something more like an index. Alive, cross-referenced, accumulating. Every domain you pass through leaves patterns behind. For me, the psychology informs how I think about product. The neuroscience informs how I think about the body. Spirituality encompasses aspects in each domain that can't be neatly quantified. And over time, they start talking to each other. Connections surface that you didn't plan for. An idea from one field quietly solves a problem in another.

The catalog isn't knowledge, exactly. It's closer to pattern recognition across contexts. A library of textures your mind can draw from when something new shows up.

## backlog refinement

For a long time, this was more frustrating than useful.

I could see entire systems in my head. Products, frameworks, experiences. Fully formed ideas that would've required a team of specialists, months of coordination, and more hours than existed in my day. I could see all possibilities at once. It's not always a gift. Sometimes it's just overwhelming. The vision was never the problem. Execution was. And for years, the gap between what I could see and what I could actually build was the defining tension of everything I tried to do.

So the ideas went into the backlog. Not abandoned. Waiting. I don't let things die if I can help it. But there were a lot of years where the only thing I could say about my best ideas was: not yet.

## action potential

When I first started working with AI, the tools weren't even that impressive yet. But something clicked immediately. Not because of what it could do, but because of what it meant.

For the first time, I had something that could take the overwhelm of seeing everything at once and help me break it into pieces. Step by step. One thing at a time. That might sound small, but for a mind that processes in all directions simultaneously, it was the difference between having ideas and actually shipping them.

Finally, the ideas and the ability to execute them exist in the same room.

The bottleneck used to be execution. Now it's curation. I can build what I see, so the harder question becomes: should I? Can I do it well? Can I maintain it? Do I want to? I'm deliberate about what I take on now. Quality matters more to me than output, and I've got no interest in unfinished business.

## beta

There's a take going around that AI turns everyone into a generalist. That anyone with a prompt can fake their way through anything.

I don't think that's playing out the way people expect.

There's been a wave of posts on LinkedIn from developers frustrated with teammates who skipped the fundamentals. No version control hygiene, no guard rails, no process. The code works until it doesn't, and when it breaks, nobody knows where to look. AI gave them speed, but speed without structure is just a faster way to get lost.

I think about it like rock climbing. When you've climbed enough different surfaces, your hands start to recognize what they're looking for before your mind catches up. You know the texture of a good hold. You know what comes next, even on a wall you've never touched, because your body has a catalog of what works. That's not something you can shortcut. It comes from time on the rock.

AI amplifies what's already there. A deep catalog becomes more powerful. An empty one just moves faster in circles.

## the material 

The thread that runs through everything I build is this: I love taking invisible things and giving them form.

The Alignment Loop is probably the best example. It's a system I'm building into Synestrology that takes sprint methodology, the same framework I used for seven years in product management, and maps it to lunar cycles personalized to your natal chart. The user never sees the Scrum underneath. What they get are timed nudges synced to their own sky: intentions at the new moon, check-ins mid-cycle, reflection at the full moon. When resistance shows up, you don't push through it with willpower. You read it as data. The shadow becomes diagnostic rather than punitive. It's a bid toward freedom.

It's designed for creative, multi-passionate people whose nervous systems need structure and permission to rest in equal measure. The kind of people who've tried every productivity system and found them all slightly violent. Astrology gave it the timing. Sprint methodology gave it the bones. Psychology gave it the intelligence. Somatic work gave it the body. None of those fields alone could have produced it. The catalog did.

That's what a catalog is for. Not knowing everything, but having stood in enough rooms to feel the outline of something that doesn't have obvious edges. You have to feel your way toward the shape of them, and that's easier when you've got a deep well to draw from.

## closing time

One way of functioning isn't better than another way of functioning. I believe it all serves a purpose, and each has its advantages given a scenario. 

The point is that many people have spent their lives building catalogs rather than credentials. Who work in spirals. Who've been told, gently or not, that they'd be unstoppable if they just picked something. 

I spent a long time wondering if the backlog was proof that something was wrong with how I work. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was just ahead of schedule.
