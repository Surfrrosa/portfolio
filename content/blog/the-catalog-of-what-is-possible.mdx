I dreamed of being an astronomer as a kid. Which led me to reading books like The Nature of Space and Time. Physics led me deep into philosophy, which never got boring. Philosophy opened something different, and that pulled me toward psychology. I got a degree in it, fell in love with neuroscience, which was my concentration. Neuroscience got me interested in biology and anatomy. Which turned into somatic work, how the body holds what the mind doesn't fully process. Somatic work led me into quantum physics, where observation affects outcome, and the measurement problem starts sounding a lot like ancient philosophy. And that landed me in full-blown spirituality.

You start looking up at the sky as a kid and end up looking inward and finding the same architecture. Every neuron could be its own galaxy. Every mind, a whole universe. The microcosm and the macrocosm keep mirroring each other the closer you look.

That sounds scattered if you're reading it from the outside. From the inside, it was one continuous thread. Each subject handed me off to the next, not because I lost interest, but because the edges of one thing kept pointing toward the center of something else. I work in spirals. I've always worked in spirals. And at a certain point, the patterns start to reveal themselves. You realize none of it was ever separate. It's all the same fabric. You were always circling the same questions, just from different rooms.

## dream weaver

Barbara Sher called people like this Scanners. Jack of all trades, renaissance man, generalist. None of them really land. They describe the outside of it but miss the inner process.

From the inside, it feels like building a catalog.

Not a pile of unfinished interests. Something more like an index. Alive, cross-referenced, accumulating. Every domain you pass through leaves patterns behind. For me, psychology informs how I think about product. The universe informs how I think about the body. And spirituality is just a catchall term that encompasses aspects in each domain that can't yet be neatly quantified. Over time, you start to see the overlap. You recognize concepts that sound eerily similar but are being spoken about in different language. Connections surface that you could've never imagined; connections that only become visible when you immerse yourself deeply in the material. It requires intense focus. It requires obsession because that's what it takes to fuel such intense focus. It's also what allows you to move through subjects quickly. 

Maybe it's closer to pattern recognition across contexts. A library of textures your mind can draw from when something new shows up.

## backlog refinement

Sometimes this was more frustrating than useful.

I could see entire systems in my head. Products, frameworks, experiences. Fully formed ideas that would've required a team of specialists, months of coordination, and more hours than existed in my day. I could see many possibilities at once. But the world wasn't built for people who operate like this. There was rarely extrinsic motivation or reward for working this way in the real world. Vision was the solution but execution was the problem; it wasn't always realistic. And for years, the gap between what I could see and what I could actually build was the defining tension of everything I tried to do.

## action potential

When I first started working with AI, the tools weren't even that impressive yet. But something clicked immediately. Not because of what it could do, but because of what it meant.

For the first time, I had something that could take the overwhelm of seeing everything at once and help me break it into pieces. Step by step. One thing at a time. That might sound small, but for a mind that processes in all directions simultaneously, it was the difference between having ideas and actually shipping them.

Finally, the ideas and the ability to execute them exist on the same plane.

The bottleneck used to be execution. Now it's curation. I can build what I see, so the harder question becomes: should I? Can I do it well? Can I maintain it? Do I want to? I'm deliberate about what I take on now. Quality matters more to me than output, and I've got no interest in unfinished business.

## beta

There's a take going around that AI turns everyone into a generalist. That anyone with a prompt can fake their way through anything.

I don't think that's playing out the way people expect.

There's been a wave of posts on LinkedIn from developers and non-developers alike frustrated with output that skips the fundamentals. No version control hygiene, no guard rails, no process. The code works until it doesn't, and when it breaks, nobody knows where to look. AI gave them speed, but speed without structure is just a faster way to get lost. I'd argue this isn't a generalist problem. A true generalist would've identified the bigger picture and approached it from a much broader angle. You change your vantage point for each and every role and process. 

I think about it like rock climbing. When you've climbed enough different surfaces, your hands start to recognize what they're looking for before your mind catches up. You know the texture of a good hold. You know what comes next, even on a wall you've never touched, because your body has a catalog of what works. That's not something you can shortcut. It comes from your every muscle in your body learning what works and what doesn't in every moment, every context, over a long period of time. 

AI amplifies what's already there. A deep catalog becomes more powerful. An empty one just moves faster in circles.

## the material 

The thread that runs through everything I build is this: I love taking invisible things and giving them form.

The Alignment Loop is probably the best example. It's a system I'm building into Synestrology that takes sprint methodology, the same framework I used for seven years in product management, and maps it to lunar cycles personalized to your natal chart. The user never sees the Scrum underneath. What they get are timed nudges synced to their own sky: intentions at the new moon, check-ins mid-cycle, reflection at the full moon. When resistance shows up, you don't push through it with willpower. You read it as data and learn how to pivot or work with it. The shadow becomes diagnostic rather than punitive. It's a bid toward freedom. It's a collection of many things I learned through the years and saw an opportunity where they align, forming something entirely new. It's something that hasn't been done yet. 

It's designed for creative, multi-passionate people whose nervous systems need structure and permission to rest in equal measure. It's a system that brings action where people tend to get lost in theory. Astrology gave it the timing. Sprint methodology gave it the scaffolding. Psychology gave it the intellect. Somatic work gave it the body. None of those fields alone could have produced it. The catalog did.

That's what a catalog is for. Not knowing everything, but having stood in enough rooms to feel the outline of something that doesn't have obvious edges. You have to feel your way toward the shape of them, and that's easier when you've got a deep well to draw from.

## closing time

One way of functioning isn't better than another way of functioning. I believe it all serves a purpose, and each has its advantages given a scenario. 

The point is that many people have spent their lives building catalogs rather than credentials. Who work in spirals. Who've been told, gently or not, that they'd be unstoppable if they just picked something. 

I spent a long time wondering if the backlog was proof that something was wrong with how I work. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was just ahead of schedule.
