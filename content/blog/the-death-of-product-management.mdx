Product management, at least as we've formally known it, is dead.

That might sound dramatic, but it's no different than when project managers saw their discipline shaken by agile. The same thing is happening now. The traditional PM role defined by backlog grooming, stakeholder wrangling, and endless roadmap iterations is dissolving. Not because the work isn't essential, but because automation, AI, and leaner teams are doing it faster and cleaner without the human overhead.

## Why the old playbook no longer works

I've lived the classic PM toolkit: JIRA dashboards, PI planning, KPIs, user stories, dependency tracking. It was valuable, but it was also fragile. The model is overly dependent on humans to stitch together dozens of moving parts. Hence the never-ending, all-day corporate meeting that has become far too common.

Today, user stories and acceptance criteria can be written in a fraction of the time with the right tools. Market research can be automated. Feature specs that once took weeks are generated in minutes. Product management is getting an overhaul.

**The PM as glue is being replaced by tools that are better at sticking things together.**

## The new era of product multipliers

So what replaces the role? A new archetype: the **Product Multiplier**.

First, I'd like to talk about why I'm using this term and where it comes from. This concept isn't new. In product circles, Marty Cagan has written about Product Ops as a "force multiplier" for product teams. Others have talked about the "multiplier effect" in terms of how strong product managers can amplify the work of everyone around them. Even outside of tech, economics uses "multipliers" to describe exponential effects.

This archetype builds on that lineage but points forward. The PM who doesn't just manage backlogs, but multiplies outcomes by combining customer insight, data fluency, AI-powered workflows, and systems thinking. It's a deliberate evolution of the role that is less about being the glue and more about being the amplifier.

A product multiplier doesn't just manage requirements; they amplify outcomes. They translate customer insights, data fluency, and AI tooling into products that feel inevitable. They're less backlog babysitter, more systems architect and product engineer.

### Skills defining this era

- **AI fluency**: From prompt engineering and workflow automation to evaluation harnessing, knowing how to bend AI in meaningful and efficient ways
- **Data intuition**: Reading signals, running experiments, forming hypotheses that drive decisions
- **Systems thinking**: Understanding how product connects to the business model, human behavior, and tech stack
- **Cross-domain literacy**: The ability to pull insights from fields outside of software and apply them intelligently and creatively to innovate in product work

## Real examples

Look at what's already happening:

**Rebecca Beach**, a former UX designer turned solopreneur, is making $20,000 per month with AI-assisted digital products.

**StackBlitz**, a web-based dev tools startup that was on the brink of collapse, launched an AI-powered coding platform called "Bolt" and gained $4 million in Annual Recurring Revenue in just 30 days.

According to the Financial Times, AI application startups like Cursor, Perplexity, Synthesia, and ElevenLabs are earning up to $200 million annually within just a few short years by building applications on large language models from OpenAI and Google.

These examples demonstrate how a founder plus a designer plus an AI toolkit can cover what used to require an entire product team.

## Who thrives, who falls behind

The PMs who thrive will be those who design, prototype, experiment, and can get weird in order to multiply their impact with technology.

The ones who fall behind? Those clinging to old methods and positioning themselves merely as team translators.

## Where we're headed

The next five years will highlight and elevate product management, with a widening gap between those who pivot and those who don't.

The future PM will be part strategist, part builder, part storyteller, and part experimenter—generating clarity independently and creating products that are faster, sharper, more avant-garde, and unmistakably prescient.

## A call to action

Ask yourself: Am I augmenting my craft with storytelling, AI-powered efficiency, data that matters, innovation, and experimentation? Or am I being left behind?

Product management isn't dying. It's leveling up.

And the only question left is: **Are you?**
