I've seen dozens of product roadmaps. Most of them are beautifully formatted, color-coded disasters.

They promise too much, assume too much, and survive exactly one sprint before reality destroys them.

The problem isn't the roadmap itself. It's what we expect it to do.

## Roadmaps Are Not Strategy

A roadmap is not your product strategy. It's a **communication artifact** that emerges from strategy.

Strategy is:
- What problems you're solving and why
- Who you're building for and what they'll pay for
- What you're deliberately *not* doing

A roadmap is:
- The next 3-6 months of bets you're placing
- The sequence you're testing those bets
- How you'll measure if those bets paid off

If your roadmap doesn't connect to a clear strategy, it's just a list of features stakeholders lobbied for.

## What Actually Works

Here's what I've learned works after 7+ years shipping products:

### 1. Time horizons, not dates
Stop promising "Q2 2025" for everything. Use buckets instead:
- **Now** (this quarter): things in progress or starting this sprint
- **Next** (next quarter): things with clear definitions and dependencies mapped
- **Later** (6-12 months): directional themes, not detailed features

This lets you commit to outcomes without committing to dates you'll miss.

### 2. Outcomes over outputs
Don't list "Redesign onboarding flow." That's an output.

Instead: "Reduce time-to-first-value by 40% for new users."

Now you can experiment with *how* to achieve that. Maybe it's not a redesign at all—maybe it's better docs, a quickstart template, or killing 3 unnecessary steps.

Outcomes give you flexibility. Outputs lock you into one solution before you've validated the problem.

### 3. Confidence levels
Not everything on your roadmap is equally certain. Mark items with confidence:
- **High confidence**: clear problem, validated solution, dependencies mapped
- **Medium confidence**: clear problem, solution hypothesis needs testing
- **Low confidence**: exploratory, might get cut if we learn it's not valuable

This sets expectations. When a "low confidence" item gets cut, no one's surprised.

### 4. Review and update every sprint
Your roadmap should be a **living document**, not a monument.

Every sprint, ask:
- What did we learn that invalidates this plan?
- What new information changed our priorities?
- Are we still solving the right problems?

If your roadmap looks identical after 3 sprints, you're not learning fast enough.

## The Real Job of a Roadmap

A roadmap exists to:
1. **Align teams** on what we're building and why
2. **Set expectations** with stakeholders and customers
3. **Enable decisions** about resources, dependencies, and tradeoffs

It's not a contract. It's not a promise. It's a **hypothesis about the future** that you'll update as you learn.

## What I Do Now

Here's my current process:

1. **Quarterly planning**: Review strategy, set 3-5 outcome-based bets for the next 90 days
2. **Sprint planning**: Break bets into experiments and features
3. **Weekly check-ins**: Track metrics, adjust based on what we're learning
4. **Monthly roadmap updates**: Communicate changes and why

No Gantt charts. No feature factories. Just bets, experiments, and iteration.

## The Bottom Line

If your roadmap is a political document designed to keep everyone happy, it will fail.

If it's a learning tool that evolves with reality, it works.

Build roadmaps that help you say no, test fast, and change direction when the data says you should.

That's what ships products.
